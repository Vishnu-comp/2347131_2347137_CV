# Student Attendance Monitoring System

## Overview
The **Student Attendance Monitoring System** uses computer vision to track the attendance of individuals within a specified environment. It leverages a pre-trained **YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once)** model to detect and count people in real-time from various media sources like images, videos, or webcam feeds. The system is built using Python, OpenCV, PyTorch, and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features
- **Image-based Attendance**: Upload and process images to count the number of people.
- **Video-based Attendance**: Load and process video files to detect and count people frame by frame.
- **Webcam-based Attendance**: Capture real-time footage from a webcam to track the count of people continuously.
- **Real-time Object Detection**: Detect and highlight people using YOLOv5.
- **Live Count Display**: Display the number of people detected on the interface in real-time.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: The core programming language for the application.
- **YOLOv5 (PyTorch)**: Pre-trained model for object detection.
- **OpenCV**: For processing images, videos, and webcam frames.
- **Tkinter**: For the graphical user interface.
- **Pillow**: For handling image transformations.
- **NumPy**: For array and image manipulation.

## Installation Requirements
